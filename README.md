## 🧠 About

This is a simple and fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (noughts and crosses) game. Two players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3×3 grid — the first to get three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins! If the grid fills up with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project is great for learning basic front-end web development and DOM manipulation.
